Hi everyone. I made a free practical initiation the 5th September 2018 for the TahitiDevOps meetup. As always, the presentation is Open Source and available here:

It is always thrilling and rewarding to train other people. Especially on practises/technologies (like Kubernetes) which I think are game changers in the industry.
In Tahiti, there are very few developers and even less devops (from what I heard we are at most 3 on the island). So, I think that we should be an even more united community in order to survive and to grow together.

Anyway, people were very interested and we actually lacked time to finish it, so we scheduled a follow up "Kubernetes 102", the 5th october.

I am very happy to see that even on a remote location like this, we do have interested and passionate people.
