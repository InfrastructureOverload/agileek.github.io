Hi everyone. This is my first post on Infrastructure Overload. The beginning was a bit chaotic and I was already struggling to find the energy and time to actually setup the blog.
This, despite the awesomeness of Github Pages, which really simplifies the hosting part. It is always hard to find a good balance in life. Especially for people like me which do not limit themselves to the working part of their life.

My idea is to write posts on what I work on a monthly basis which is implementing DevOps on various teams and environments. This means working on the whole process of shipping reliable and innovative software consistently. I will write a more detailed post on this later on.

As a professional, my main point of interests are OpenSource Softwares, Linux and programming. Yes that is pretty broad, which is great as I will always find something cool to be curious about. :)

Nowadays, I am mostly containerizing applications, and managing/learning Kubernetes clusters.
